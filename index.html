                <p>I am a senior studying computer science at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. <br><br>
                    My interests are primarily in full stack software engineering and I am always trying to learn more to develop and expand my front-end and back-end knowledge. I strive to find work and/or projects that require me to engage in critical thinking and problem solving skills. As the tech field is continuously expanding, I am open to learning about new subfields and the potential they bring to the world. <br><br>
                    Additionally, I am pursuing a minor in Gender, Women's, and Sexuality Studies. I consider myself both a part of and an advocate for the lgbtq+ community. My advocacy intersects with my interests in technology primarily through increasing representation for people of all genders, sexualities, races, abilities, etc, specifically within computing and information technology. <br><br>
                    My internship experience has involved work with business analytics and full stack web development as well as research work with intelligent systems, deep learning, and foundation models.<br><br>You can find more details on my <a class="black" href="./pages/resume.html">resume!</a></p>
